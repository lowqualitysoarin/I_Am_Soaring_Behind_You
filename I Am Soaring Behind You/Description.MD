"I Am Soaring Behind You" is a Survival Horror, Task Based, Roguelike minigame highly inspired by some Indie Horror Games.

You take control of a random mandatory Soldier who accepted the job from the Commander. No one ever taken the job after the multiple dissapearance of 
other people after accepting the task. Soo you went ahead and decided to cooperate and do the job, what could go wrong?
