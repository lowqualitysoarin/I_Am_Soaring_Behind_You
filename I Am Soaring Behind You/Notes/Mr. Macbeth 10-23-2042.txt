    That horse is just gone, he doesn't show up. And our signals has been jammed 
by an unknown source, despite they are all fine. Which I am suspecting to be him. 
Jeez only 6 of our team here are left. The others just checks out there and never
came back. We are planning our way out of here, even told our head commander.. 
And he just yelled at us mad that we are being dumbasses for letting that horse 
out of it's cage and told us that we aren't getting out of here without that pony.
But fuck it. I don't fucking care about our commander, we are just getting
out of here. It's too dangerous.

    We are just gonna stay on our campsite a little while and see if we still have
a chance catching him. If we don't we are getting out of here on 6:00 PM.
