    God dang it. That horse flew away, because our guard is sick. I've already been 
telling the head of command to get a new one because the current one is feeling weak 
and sick. The medic confirms it aswell, poor guy got a fever always staying up. But 
the commander was such an arse and doesn't want to give us a replacement. He also 
threatened us.

    Back to topic, that dangerous light or sky blue pegasus got out of it's den.
I already said what caused it. We are going to have a hard time catching him again.
