    FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!!! He is there... He killed the others.
I just watched the others helplessly get taken by him. Their
corpse just.. Disappeared...

    There is seem no way I am getting out of here alive. Shit..
Whoever gets to see this note, just leave immediately if you want 
to live.

    I am going to say that, just incase you are being chased by
him. This note will guide you. I'm the one who coded his Artificial
Intelligence. His name is "Soarin'", "Clipper" by nickname. I called
him that since that's his name and nickname in the show... Though this
this one's no match from the original one. And he also phases through walls, 
terrains, etchetera. 

He has multiple states of attacks. These are "Dash Towards", "Chase", and "Faking".

"Dash towards" is really dangerous. You really need to be aware because he is fast, 
and can grab you and then.. You know what happens next. He sometimes fakes this 
attack. But still always be careful. To fend him off you'll have to look at him fast.

"Chase" is self explanatory, he chases you and he doesn't vanish instantly.
Just look away and look back at him multiple times and he might disappear.. For now..

"Faking" this one is one of his dangerous attacks. You may think he is friendly or
will do a harmless scare. Well there is a possibility he might do a harmless one but there
is a 50% chance that he'll do a lethal one. If you see him standing still.. Please don't 
trust it, don't at any circumstances ever approach him. Because he'll dash right into you fast.

    That's all I know and what I've put into him. Soo goodluck out there, and pray if
you are ever gonna get out.
