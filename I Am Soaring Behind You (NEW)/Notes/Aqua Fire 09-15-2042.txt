    Leaving this here incase someone noticed. I found a vault strangely placed
somewhere, it's near some of the points. Though it seems like it needs a key
to open it, and I haven't found any keys but. My best bet that one of my colleagues
found a key and placed it somewhere near our old tent. And I don't know if the
key is still there.. But its worth a try.
